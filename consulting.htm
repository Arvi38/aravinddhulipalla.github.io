During the Summer of 1979 and from May 1980 to December 1981 employed as a Faculty Fellow in the Telecommunications Branch on the Beacon Collision Avoidance System, (BCAS). Conducted the feasibility studies of BCAS, its compatibility with the existing surveillance systems like Automatic Traffic Control Radar Beacon Systems (ATCRBS), Automatic Traffic Advisory & Resolution Services (ATARS) and Air Traffic Control (ATC).  The BCAS capability of providing safe-separation while maintaining an acceptable false alarm rate lesser to ATARS and conflict alert. Mode Singularities and Garble & Fruits in high traffic density environment and constancy of antenna rotation were also investigated. Mathematical modeling and computer simulation for the SSR antenna under non-ideal situation was carried out in its entirely.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size"4">The technical expertise on passive, semi-active/active and Full-BCAS was developed through an intensive study of the literature available on the subject and participate with FAA and TSC project staff. Geometrical analysis of the three-dimensional two-site BCAS problem was carried out in its entirety. Technically advised group in carrying out (i) covariance analysis of three dimensional equations (ii) the simulation of the covariance analysis (iii) the feasibility study of estimating the target's altitude, when the target is equipped only with Mode A transponder (iv) the determination of range and altitude with the geometry of two target aircraft equipped with BCAS without ground surveillance (v) the simulation of the range and altitude in the situation in order to avoid collisions absolutely (vi) carried out System Modeling for secondary surveillance radar (SSR)'s antenna under non ideal situation of nonuniform rotation rate and its impact on calculation of intruder aircraft's range and bearing, and (vii) carried out error analysis of threat alert and collision avoidance systems (TCAS) making use of optimal estimation techniques including Kalman filtering that provides an upper bound on the system errors by indicating lower bound on the system errors for a specific set of selected scenarios.
